The opearator algebras theory combines the techniques of its three main streams:
- theory of ${ C^{\ast} }$-algebras - noncommutative topology,
- theory of von Neumann algebras - noncommuative measure theory,
- theory of Jordan structures.

${ C^{\ast} }$-algebras can be thought of as a simultaineous generalization of commutative and infinite-dimensional matrix algebras.

An associative complex algebra ${ (A,+,\cdot,\ast) }$ is called a ${ \ast }$-algebra if the operation ${ \ast }$ obeys the following rules
1. ${ a^{\ast\ast}=a }$
1. ${ (a+b)^{\ast}=a^{\ast}+b^{\ast} }$
1. ${ (\lambda a)^{\ast}=\bar{\lambda}a^{\ast} }$
1. ${ (ab)^{\ast}=b^{\ast}a^{\ast} }$

Let ${ A }$ be a cpx ${ \ast }$-algebra which is a Banach space with the norm ${ \lVert \cdot \rVert }$. ${ A }$ is said to be an involutive Banach algebra if the following conditions are satisfied for all ${ a,b \in A }$:
1. ${ \lVert ab \rVert \le \lVert a \rVert \cdot \lVert b \rVert}$
1. ${ \lVert a^{\ast} \rVert = \lVert a \rVert }$

A ${ C^{\ast} }$-algebra is an involutive Banach algebra satisfying
1. ${ \lVert a^{\ast}a \rVert =\lVert a \rVert^{2} }$
